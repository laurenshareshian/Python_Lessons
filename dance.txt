Walking up to me expecting
Walking up to me
Expecting words
It happens all the time

Present company accepted
Present company
Except the worst
It happens every night

Ah-ahh
Present company
Excluded every time

Ah-ahh
Present company
The best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean

Present company expect it
Present company
Just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

Ah-ahh
Present company
Excluded in every way

Ah-ahh
Present company
Makes me wanna stay

Killing it with close inspecting
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed

Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
Works just like a need

Ah-ahh
Present company
Excluded in the night

Ah-ahh
Present company
Included in the fight

Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
