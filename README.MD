These are Jupyter Notebook lessons that I'll be using to teach Python at my high school. They are a work in progress. I've put these up on a web server so that my students can access them at www.portlandpython.com . Thanks to Jess Hamrick for her description of how to do it here: https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/deploying-jupyterhub-for-education/  and for her repo https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-teaching . Also thanks to Eric Matthes for his Intro to Programming Notebooks: https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming and to Chuck Severance for his open resource book: https://www.py4e.com/book.php
